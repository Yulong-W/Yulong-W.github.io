<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
Christopher Manning is the inaugural Thomas M. Siebel Professor in Machine Learning in the
Departments of Linguistics and Computer Science at Stanford University, 
Director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL), 
and an Associate Director of the Stanford Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Institute (HAI). 
His research goal is computers that can intelligently process, understand, and generate human language material. 
Manning is a leader in applying Deep Learning to Natural Language Processing, with well-known research on the GloVe model of word vectors, question answering, tree-recursive neural networks, machine reasoning, neural network dependency parsing, neural machine translation, sentiment analysis, and deep language understanding.
He also focuses on computational linguistic approaches to parsing, natural language inference and multilingual language processing, including being a principal developer of Stanford Dependencies and 
<a href="http://universaldependencies.org/">Universal Dependencies</a>.
Manning has coauthored leading textbooks on statistical approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Manning and Schütze 1999) and information retrieval (Manning, Raghavan, and Schütze, 2008), as well as linguistic monographs on ergativity and complex predicates. 
He is an ACM Fellow, a AAAI Fellow, and an ACL Fellow, and a Past President of the ACL (2015).
His research has won ACL, Coling, EMNLP, and CHI Best Paper Awards. 
He has a B.A. (Hons) from The Australian National University and a Ph.D. from Stanford in 1994, and he held faculty positions at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Sydney before returning to Stanford. He is the founder of the <a href="/">Stanford NLP group</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/stanfordnlp">@stanfordnlp</a>) and manages development of the <a href="//stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/">Stanford CoreNLP</a> software.

In 2013, I was program co-chair for the first
<a href="http://www.iclr.cc/">International
Conference on Learning Representations</a> (see: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/representationlearning2013/">ICLR 2013</a>).
The 2013 edition was a really 
fun workshop-scale event.  Since then, ICLR has grown in size exponentially.
</p>

<p>
In 2013, I helped organize the first
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cvscworkshop/">CVSC
  workshop</a>.  It was a really
lively workshop.  I also helped organize
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cvscworkshop2014/">a second
  Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their
  Compositionality</a> at EACL 2014.
</p>

<p>
I helped organize a 
<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/events/illvi2014/">Workshop on
Interactive Language Learning, Visualization, and Interfaces</a>

<h2>Courses</h2>

<p><b>Online videos!</b> You can find complete videos for four courses on NLP that I have (co-)taught online:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z">CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning | Winter 2019</a> by Christopher Manning and Abi See on YouTube [<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1194/">slides</a>]. If you're ready to dive into the latest in deep learning for NLP, you should do this course! It assumes more mathematics prerequisites (multivariate calc, linear algebra) than the courses below.
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6">Lecture Collection | Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning</a> (a.k.a.

It looks like you can only watch these videos with Flash. ☹️ </li>
</ul>

<p>In Fall 2016, I taught <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/linguist/linguist278/linguist278.1172/">Linguistics
278: Programming for linguists</a> (and any other digital humanities or
text-oriented social science students who think it might be a good
match), mainly using Jupyter notebooks.</p>

<p>I co-taught tutorials on 
<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/NAACL2013/">Deep Learning for NLP</a> at 
ACL 2012 with Yoshua Bengio and Richard Socher, and at
NAACL 2013 with Richard Socher. Slides, references, and videos are
available.
</p>

<p>In 2012, I co-taught
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp">
a free online course on Natural Language
Processing</a>, one of the earliest MOOCs on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>,

<!-- https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp -->
We haven't found the time to revise it and teach a second version, but
you can watch all the videos (see above).
</p>

<p>In June 2011, I taught a tutorial
<a href="/~manning/courses/DigitalHumanities/">Natural Language
  Processing Tools for the Digital Humanities</a> at
